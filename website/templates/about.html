            I am an Aotearoa New Zealand-based designer who cares. Throughout my professional and personal work, I integrate design principles to demonstrate evidence-based design. 
            I place end-users at the heart of my work to produce tailored outcomes that solve real-world problems. 
            My work unites typography and illustration to create visually arresting pieces of design that are unconventional and thought-provoking.
