# Welcome to Reconnect

Reconnect aggregates the feeds of a variety of video game writers, with the goal of highlighting the efforts of writers covering video games, games development, and the industry.

## How it works ü§î
- Built using Django, Python, CSS (bootstrap), HTML, Javascript
- Hosted on Python Anywhere
- Pulls articles from RSS feeds several times a day
- Presents the articles in a latest, popular, and curated feeds (plus a hidden random feed üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è)
- Articles can be searched
- A holsitic RSS feed exists, but if you want to follow a specific site, those RSS feeds are available to. 
- Clicking on an article upvotes it, increases its chances of showing on the popular feed.
- Every day articles are chosen to be curated, and the most recent 20 are viewable on the curated panel
- An accompanying Substack provides a weekly newsletter recapping some of the best articles of the week and some extra information.

## Why ‚ÅâÔ∏è
- Games Media is being decimated left right and centre.
- Games writing is no longer being valued, those sites that remain just post news, guides, and SEO bait.
- Existing writers who have left (or fired) from their jobs are out their making blogs, sometimes needing the income to surivive.
- Up and coming writers are struggling to get their writing seen, and to grow their craft
- Industry specialists have so much insight to add to the community, that it needs to be surfaced.
- I can't hire these people myself, but I can try and help solve the problem of discoverability.
- Reconnect aims to find anyone doing decent games writing, and to pipe their amazing work into the platform, increasing their chance of finding a bigger audience.
- Meanwhile, people like me who love games writing and can't find it any more on the mainstrea sites, have a place to visit and find something awesome. 

## Designed by Micah Tabak
I am an Aotearoa-based designer who cares. Throughout my professional and personal work, I integrate design principles to demonstrate evidence-based design. I place end-users at the heart of my work to produce tailored outcomes that solve real-world problems. My work unites typography and illustration to create visually arresting pieces of design that are unconventional and thought-provoking.
